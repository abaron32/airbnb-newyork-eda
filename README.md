# Exploratory Data Analysis: Airbnb New York dataset

The dataset used in this project contains Airbnb data on New York City. Some of the information we have in the dataset is about hosts, regions and prices.

In the explore.ipynb notebook there is an exploration of the dataset. 

In app.py there is a pipeline that cleans the data, so it is ready for future modelling.
